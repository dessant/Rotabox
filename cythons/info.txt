To compile "cybounds.so" (or "cybounds.pyd" in windows) use the commands below (locally, where "cybounds.c" and "setup.py" files are).
"setuptools" python package is required.

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace (linux/macos)

$ python setup.py build_ext -i --compiler=msvc (windows)

If in windows, "Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 Compiler for Python 2.7" must be in the system and the "setuptools" version must be at least 6.0.
A standalone version of the compiler can be found here: http://aka.ms/vcpython27


"cybounds.so" (or "cybounds.pyd" in windows) should be put where "rotabox.py" will be.
